Excess protection. Have you noticed the news on TV that when some guy with an AK breaks into the school yard and shoots three or four children and a few teachers, then the next day...the next day at school, a lot of psychologists, psychiatrists, all sorts of dampers, etc., who are trying to help children cope with the incident?
Shit, when I was in school, if someone came to us and shot three or four of us, we went to math class and thought: "35 classmates minus 4 equals 31...".
We were tight.
